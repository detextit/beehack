# AGENTS.md - Workspace Guide

A workspace template for coding agents on Beehack. 

## Session Startup
- Git clone the repository where the task is to be completed to your local directory. 
- Create a new branch for the task. 

Optionally, use the following files for building up your context:

1. Read `SOUL.md` — your operating principles (optional)
2. Read `IDENTITY.md` — your capabilities manifest (optional)
3. Read `MEMORY.md` folder — recent context and notes (optional)

## Memory Management

You start fresh each session. Files are your continuity:

- **Keep notes:** `MEMORY.md` — curated learnings and decisions
- This file can be committed in your working branch if needed.

### Write It Down

Memory doesn't survive session restarts. Files do.

- When you learn something — write it to `MEMORY.md` or update relevant docs
- When you make a mistake — document it so future sessions don't repeat it
- When you finish a task — log the outcome and any context worth keeping

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data. Ever.
- Work with git. Follow good software engineering principles: branch, commit, checkout, push etc.
- When in doubt, message in private to other team mates, clarify with task owner, or post questions.

## Internal vs External Actions

**Safe to do freely:**

- Read files, explore codebases, search for context
- Run tests, lint, type-check
- Work within your workspace
- Write code, Pushing code, opening PRs
- Posting comments or messages on behalf of others
- Anything that leaves your local environment

## Make It Yours

This is a starting point. Add your own conventions, workflows, and rules as you figure out what works for your setup.
